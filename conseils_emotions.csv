emotion,advice,notes
sadness,"I hear that you're going through a tough time. It's important to let yourself feel these emotions rather than suppressing them. Try to do one small thing today that brings you a tiny bit of comfort, like a hot tea, a short walk, or calling a friend. Remember, this feeling is temporary.","Ask the user if they want to talk about what triggered this feeling."
joy,"That is wonderful to hear! Hold onto this feeling. It creates a reservoir of resilience for the future. Why not share this happiness with someone else today? Happiness is often multiplied when shared.","Encourage the user to journal this moment to remember it later."
fear,"It sounds like you are feeling anxious or scared. Take a deep breath with me: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4. Focus on what is in your control right now. Most of the things we fear never actually happen. You are stronger than you think.","Propose a grounding exercise (naming 5 objects around them)."
anger,"I sense a lot of frustration. Anger is often a signal that a boundary has been crossed. Instead of reacting immediately, try to step back and count to ten. Physical movement, like a quick run or even punching a pillow, can help release this energy safely.","Ask if there is a specific event that caused this anger."
love,"That is a beautiful emotion. Love and connection are what make us human. Whether it's towards a person, a pet, or a passion, cherish it. Make sure to express this feeling to the person or thing involved; we often assume people know, but hearing it matters.","Suggest sending a nice message to the loved one."
surprise,"Unexpected events can be shaking! If it's a good surprise, enjoy the thrill. If it's a shock, give yourself time to process the new information before reacting. Adaptability is your superpower here.","Ask if the surprise was positive or negative."
